# co-estimator

This repository contains the results of the power systems state estimation developed by USE for the **COCOON** European project.

## Repository Structure

The code and results are organized into multiple folders, each representing a specific test case or scenario. Each folder follows a consistent internal structure:
/test_case_name\
│\
├── data/ # JSON files containing results from simulation tests\
├── figs/ # Graphical representations (plots, charts, etc.) of the test results\
└── README.md # Interpretation and explanation of the test case and its results\


### `data/` Folder
Contains `.json` files with the output data generated from the simulations. These files can be used for further analysis or validation.

### `figs/` Folder
Includes visualizations of the simulation results in image format (PDF). These plots help in understanding trends, anomalies, and overall system behavior.

### `README.md`
Each test case includes its own `README.md` file, offering an interpretation of the simulation, key findings, and any relevant notes for understanding the results.

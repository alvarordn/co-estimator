# Dummy Attacks

This folder contains test cases simulating **dummy false data injection (FDI) attacks**, where raw measurements are altered without considering the physical or operational constraints of the power system.

These attacks can be categorized as:

- **Gross dummy attacks**: Large, unrealistic changes in measurements. Likely launched by attackers with little knowledge of power systems and easily detectable by basic FDII checks.
- **Mild dummy attacks**: Subtle changes that respect basic physical limits (e.g., voltage ranges, capacity bounds). These require more advanced detection techniques based on statistical analysis and model consistency checks.
